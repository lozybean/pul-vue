              1. What is Sift-PULs database(Specific functional Polysaccharide utilization locus)?
            </h1>
            <p>
              Sift-PUL database is a public repository providing predicted PULs with specific functional annotations. The key difference between sift-PUL and other PUL databases (e.g. PULDB, CGCs and dbCAN-PUL) is the functional annotation for each predicted PUL.
            </p>

            <h1>2. Signature genes specific for each polysaccharide are used for Sift-PUL prediction</h1>
            <p>
              The key to predicting PUL is what signature genes (also called as marker genes) are selected, for example SusC/D and carbohydrate active enzymes are used in PULDB and transcription factor, sugar transporter and carbohydrate active enzymes are used in CGCs. Signature genes used for Sift-PUL prediction are specific for each polysaccharide and are classified into two categories: core genes (backbone monosaccharideâ€™s metabolic genes) and alternative genes (carbohydrate active enzymes). 
            </p>

            <h1>3. How do we predict sift-PULs?</h1>
            <p>
              A sift-PUL specific for one polysaccharide must have all corresponding core genes and at least one corresponding alternative gene. To ensure specificity, most Hmmer models of core genes and alternative genes were rebuilt locally.
